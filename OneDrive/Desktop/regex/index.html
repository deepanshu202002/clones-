MERN comprises the following tools:

MongoDB (a non-SQL database)
ExpressJS (an HTTP server that is excellent for APIs)
ReactJS (a leading Web Application framework)
NodeJS (a tool to manage your tools)
<h3>ANGULAR</h3>
Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:

A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code
<h3>MONGODB</h3>

The growing trend towards Big Data and NoSQL databases like MongoDB has seen a surge in commercial and open-source MongoDB deployments across multiple industries. MongoDB is designed for fast and powerful data analytics and easy scalability. It can deliver the most common Big Data functions, including data modeling, query optimization, query isolation, and scalable storage. 

MongoDB's strength lies in its being the only NoSQL database that supports SQL-based queries, making it ideal for advanced data analytics and ad hoc data management. Companies across verticals like finance, media, entertainment, e-commerce, retail, gaming, SaaS, health tech, and education have deployed MongoDB for varied use cases.

<h3>EXPRESS.JS</h3>
The ExpressJS API is a great starting point, especially if you are looking for an easy way to create a very minimal server. If you decide to start from scratch and try to do a full service, ExpressJS has powerful features that allow you to add a backend API dynamically. This capability comes in very handy if you decide to add additional functionality to the front end by using a third-party library. 
<h3>REACTJS</h3>
React has its way of passing data and state through your components. You get to specify state, props, and setState with ease. React also handles state management and resetting for you. That means you can split your UI into multiple components that re-use some parts of the state tree and easily keep details up-to-date. React lets you write large components in a fluent style and sends the state as props.
<h3>NODEjS</h3>
There is a variety of libraries and tooling available, allowing you to build robust applications with only a few code lines.
You can develop highly interactive applications by leveraging HTTP, database, and other third party software without creating an API first.
It's written in the JavaScript language, which is widely used globally and allows you to build cross-platform applications that can be used in the browser, iOS, Android, and other operating systems.
It's built on the v8 JavaScript engine, allowing developers to run JavaScript code in the browser without any external libraries' needs.
